# PSD-AP06 (SOS message transmitter) 
Welcome to our final project repo, the goal of our project is to make an encrypt/decrypt message transmitter with implementing Caesear Shift Cipher

# How it works?
First the user needs to enter some passwords to access the messaging feature, passwords can be found passwords in codes or just by brute force until you find the correct answer. After that the user can choose whether to use the "emergency button function" or send the message manually. If the user chooses to use the emergency button, the program will automatically send an encrypted message, if the user chooses to send the message manually, then the user can input the message manually and determine the input sequence shift.
