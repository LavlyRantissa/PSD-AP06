# PSD-AP06 (SOS message transmitter)

Welcome to our final project repo, the goal of our project is to make an encrypt/decrypt message transmitter with implementing Casear shift logic

## Our Program Features

- Caesar Shift Cipher Encryption/Decryption (6 Position Shift): Secure messages with a simple but effective encryption method.
- Emergency Signals (SOS and Help): Allows users to quickly send emergency messages.
- Security Code: Requires users to enter a security code before activating the system, thereby preventing unauthorized access.


# How it works?
First the user needs to enter some passwords to access the messaging feature, passwords can be found passwords in codes or just by brute force until you find the correct answer. After that the user can choose whether to use the "emergency button function" or send the message manually. If the user chooses to use the emergency button, the program will automatically send an encrypted message, if the user chooses to send the message manually, then the user can input the message manually and determine the input sequence shift.

## Tech

This application is built using:

- [VHDL] - A programming language used to describe and model digital electronic systems.
- [VSCode] - An application used for creating VHDL programs for the SOS Message Transmitter.
- [ModelSim] - An application used to simulate the VHDL program that has been created.
